# Raspi-NeoPixelStrip
A Raspberry Pi Driven NeoPixelStrip - does various patterns on a WS2812 strip.  This uses rpi_ws281x 2.0.3 library, which is available at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rpi_ws281x/2.0.3 
It worked with previous versions as well.  It also makes use of code to drive the pixels as noted within the code (NeoPixel library strandtest example by Author: Tony DiCola (tony@tonydicola.com)).  I think Tony's code was originally for the Arduino, but works fine on the Pi.
